# Book Issuing System - Fixes Applied

## Issues Fixed:

### 1. **SQL Error in Update Statement**
**Problem:** Line 26 had `IssueCopies` instead of `IssuedCopies`
**Fix:** Changed to `UPDATE books SET IssuedCopies=IssuedCopies+1`

### 2. **Logic Error in Copy Management**
**Problem:** Was subtracting from IssuedCopies instead of adding
**Fix:** Now properly increments IssuedCopies when a book is issued

### 3. **Missing Availability Check**
**Problem:** No check if book copies are available before issuing
**Fix:** Added availability check to prevent issuing out-of-stock books

### 4. **Missing Author Information**
**Problem:** Book lookup didn't show author details
**Fix:** Updated get_book.php to include author information via JOIN

### 5. **Misleading Form Label**
**Problem:** Form said "Book ID" but actually used ISBN
**Fix:** Changed label to "ISBN Number" with helpful placeholder

### 6. **No Error/Success Messages**
**Problem:** Blank page with no feedback on success/failure
**Fix:** Added proper error and success message display

### 7. **Better Error Handling**
**Problem:** Poor JavaScript error handling
**Fix:** Added proper error callbacks and user-friendly messages
