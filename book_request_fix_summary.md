# Book Request System Fix Summary

## Problem Identified
Students were unable to request books due to database field type mismatches and inadequate error handling.

## Root Cause
The `requestedbookdetails` table had incorrect field types:
- `ISBNNumber` was defined as `INT(11)` but ISBN numbers are strings (e.g., "9780385474542")
- `BookPrice` was defined as `INT(11)` but prices are decimal values (e.g., 65.00)

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Database Structure Fixes
```sql
-- Fixed ISBN field to accept string values
ALTER TABLE requestedbookdetails MODIFY COLUMN ISBNNumber VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL;

-- Fixed price field to handle decimal values
ALTER TABLE requestedbookdetails MODIFY COLUMN BookPrice DECIMAL(10,2) NOT NULL;
```

### 2. Error Handling Improvements
- **temp.php**: Added comprehensive error handling with try-catch blocks
- **temp.php**: Enabled error reporting for debugging
- **request-a-book.php**: Enabled error reporting
- **temp.php**: Improved user feedback messages
- **temp.php**: Added proper exit statements after redirects

### 3. Logic Improvements
- Changed condition from `== 2` to `>= 2` for request limit check
- Added verification that database insert was successful
- Better error messages that include book names
- Proper exception handling for database operations

### 4. Database Schema Update
- **library.sql**: Updated table structure to reflect correct field types
- Ensures future installations will have correct structure

## Files Modified

### Core Functionality
- **temp.php**: Book request processing logic
- **request-a-book.php**: Book request interface
- **library.sql**: Database schema definition

### Testing & Debugging
- **test-book-request.php**: Comprehensive test page for debugging

## Current Table Structure
```sql
requestedbookdetails:
- StudentID: varchar(20)
- StudName: varchar(40) 
- BookName: varchar(50)
- CategoryName: varchar(20)
- AuthorName: varchar(50)
- ISBNNumber: varchar(20)  ← Fixed from INT
- BookPrice: decimal(10,2) ← Fixed from INT
```

## User Experience Improvements
- Clear error messages when requests fail
- Informative success messages including book names
- Proper handling of duplicate request attempts
- Enforcement of 2-book request limit
- Better feedback for various error conditions

## Testing Recommendations
1. Test with valid student login
2. Try requesting a book (should work now)
3. Try requesting the same book twice (should show error)
4. Try requesting a third book (should enforce limit)
5. Check admin panel to see requested books

## Test Data Available
- **Student ID**: 20857953
- **Student Email**: officialjwise20@gmail.com  
- **Available Books**: Multiple books with proper ISBN numbers
- **Test Page**: `/test-book-request.php`

The book request system should now work properly with proper error handling and user feedback.
