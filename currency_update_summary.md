## Changes Made

### Labels and Headers
- Form labels now specify "Price in GH₵" for clarity

- Added helpful placeholder text for form inputs

### Price Display Format
- All price displays now show currency symbol: **GH₵XX.XX**
- Added `number_format($price, 2)` for consistent decimal formatting
- Prices display with 2 decimal places (e.g., GH₵25.00, GH₵120.50)

### User Experience Improvements

## Database Structure
The database structure remains unchanged - prices are still stored as DECIMAL(10,2) in the `BookPrice` field. Only the display formatting and labels have been updated.

1. Test book addition with new price format
2. Test book editing with currency display
3. Verify price display in all book listing pages
4. Check book request functionality with new currency format

## Notes
- Currency symbol GH₵ is properly encoded and displays correctly
- Number formatting ensures consistent decimal display
- All existing book price data remains intact
- Changes are cosmetic/display-only, no data migration required
